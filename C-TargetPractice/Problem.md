## Problem Description

A 10×10 target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.

Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.

### Input:
- The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

- Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either X (representing an arrow) or .(representing no arrow).

### Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.

### Example:

**Input:**
