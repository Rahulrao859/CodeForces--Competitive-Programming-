## Problem Description

You are given a binary array `a` of `n` elements, where each element is either `0` or `1`.

A **blank space** is a segment of consecutive elements consisting of only `0`s. Your task is to find the length of the longest blank space.

### Input:
- The first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) — the length of the array.
  - The second line contains `n` space-separated integers `a[i]` (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 1) — the elements of the array.

### Output:
For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest blank space.

### Example:
